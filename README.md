# imgSeg-fcm-fp
Implementation of FCM and FCMFP algorithms for image segmentation. Second part of the work is a calculation of milk estimation on breast of women using thermographic images.

teste.py Kmeans algorithm with first prototype of printing function, substituted by projeto.py

projeto.py Kmeans algorithm using the axis information(spacial context), in the latter programs it was changed into color spaces(basically just changing the Euclidean distance calculation)

proj.py FCM algorithm and can calculate milk-estimation by commenting the appropriate lines of code (RGB color space)

projetoRecente.py FCM algorithm using CIELAB colorspace (bad results, substituted by proj.py)

projfp.py FCMFP algorithm, calculation of best cluster choice with Xie Beni measure

projetofp.py FCMFP algorithm for the milk estimation

classifica.py calculates the segmentation accuracy

algo.py a prototype of the classification accuracy
