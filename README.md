# imgSeg-fcm-fp
Implementation of FCM and FCMFP algorithms for image segmentation. Second part of the work is a calculation of milk estimation on breast of women using thermographic images.

## kmeans.py 
Kmeans algorithm using the axis information(spacial context), in the latter programs it was changed into color spaces

## fcm.py
FCM algorithm and can calculate milk-estimation

## fcmfp.py 
FCMFP algorithm

## accuracy.py 
calculates the segmentation accuracy
